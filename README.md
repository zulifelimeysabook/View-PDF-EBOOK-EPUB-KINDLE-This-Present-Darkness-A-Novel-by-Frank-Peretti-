This Present Darkness: A Novel by Frank Peretti Book Review

Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: GreatChristianRead
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2017
Review: This Present Darkness was a very enjoyable book to read. Through the story, the author emphasized the importance and power of prayer which greatly effects the lives of people all around. The story portrays the unseen, heavenly actions of God and his angels, as well as the deceitful and conniving works of the Devil, who only works to destroy the saints of God. I personally would recommend this story to all ages of readers because it emphasizes the love of God towards his people, the power of God above Satan, and the need and importance of a praying Church of Christ. This Present Darkness reveals the truth that without prayer to God, anyone, Christian or non-Christian, can fall under the lies and deceptions of the Devil.

Title: Absolutelytrash
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2021
Review: Y'all, I couldn't even make it halfway through this book. It's trash, but it really helped inform certain sects of Evangelicalism. I'd be curious if Peretti himself believes this still, or if he ever did. I do believe in good and evil, and to a certain extent angels and demons. But I don't think you can paint ANYTHING with a broad brush and declare it all good or all bad. This book tries to say that ALL colleges and all humanities' studies are bad/evil. And that woman who won't submit to a man is evil. If it gives you any idea what kind of ride the reader is in for, the book uses the term "Oriental" to describe a person/angel. It has a HEAVY bias against higher education and Psychology in particular. And Marshall Hogan complains about a pastor being too into "saving the whales". It also refers to something difficult as an "indian arm wrestle". If nothing else, the publisher should update to remove these racist phrases.

Title: ItsfunnybecausewhenIdropmykeys
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2016
Review: Everyone should read this book! It should be a movie. This book will make you think about spiritual warfare in the most realistic way. It caused me to spend more time in prayer and become more focused on salvation matters. It's funny - because when I drop my keys, get stuck in traffic, or seem to have all these things happen to me that I can't explain - I don't get as upset anymore. I just Thank God because you never know if that traffic jam or time it took to pick up my keys saved me from something. MUST READ. MUST SHARE. I buy copies all the time and pass them on. ANNOINTED BOOK. May be fiction - but I guarantee you will find multiple similarities in your own life, church, community and faith. Will continue to order This Present Darkness and its sequel - Piercing the Darkness - and pass them around. It is life-changing.

Title: AnOutstandingBookonSpiritualWarfareAndHowToFight
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2017
Review: Powerful, compelling and captivating -- yet replete with spiritual observations and lessons. Yes, you can read a great book and learn spiritual truth as you read and I cannot recommend this book too highly. From teens to senior adults, this book will reinforce your faith while you struggle to put it down. The first time I read it was a Sunday afternoon, the day before my daughters left on church-related missions trips to Central and South America -- it inspired me to pray fervently for my daughters every day they were gone. Yes, they both returned home safely.

Title: AMustRead
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2016
Review: One of the best books I have read on Spiritual Warfare! Even though it is fictional, Peretti opens our eyes to the spiritual battle going on around us as Christians. The way he imagines the battle unfolding is very Biblical and thus makes reading passages like Ephesians 6 come alive. Though the book falls into the science fiction category I wouldn't say it is to strange or weird. I have read a lot of other Christian fiction books that are farther out there than this one. I would recommend this to every Christian! A Must Read

Title: Besoberandvigilant
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2021
Review: I must be honest. I met Frank Peretti over a year ago, but it took me this long to read this book. I normally read something much lighter. But after 2020, I decided to venture into something more serious. Though this book is fictional, it's description of spiritual warfare couldn't be more timely. Like First Peter 5:8 says, "the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour." The lesson learned is that we shouldn't think we will recognize the devil or his demons when they show up. And the best defense is to pray. And pray, and pray some more! This book will grip you from the beginning, and hang onto your heart for a long time!

Title: Goodreadandabriefpullingbackofthecurtain
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2017
Review: Bought this for my niece. I had read it shortly after college and thought she might enjoy it after having some discussions about the spiritual realm. Peretti wrote an enjoyable story that shows how all these forces play out in the lives of people through a mystery/thriller. Good thought-provoking book to have in your collection with the classic C.S. Lewis book The Scewtape Letters.

Title: Goodbookbutnotbiblicallysound
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022
Review: This is a good book to read and it makes a person think about spiritual warfare but how the author writes about that spiritual warfare is not biblically sound at all. Yes, prayer is useful and very important but not for the reason the author uses it for in this book. That makes this book dangerous because it is twisting what the Bible says. Even for the sake of a story, God clearly says in the Bible to do that is wrong. He also never once says that His angels are useless and powerless against Satan and his minions unless God's children are actively praying, as in this book. In fact, God tells us about how strong His angels are, without any qualifiers! This book can easily lead people down the wrong path and that is not right and should not be tolerated. I would suggest you find a book that is in line with the Bible to read. That will do you far better than the twisted half-truths in this book.
